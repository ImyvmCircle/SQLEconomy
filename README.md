# SQLEconomy
forked from https://gitlab.com/andrewward2001/SQLEconomy

SQLEconomy is a bukkit plugin that combines MySQL and SQLite and puts them into an economy plugin. The great thing about SQL is it's extremely organized. Each table is like a spreadsheet, keeping everything organized. If yo don't have and experience with SQL, SQLEconomy doesn't care! It will create a table for you, all on its own.
